Darkside Mode is a simple, flexible and (mostly) compatible Doom mod that adds the slot machine system (AKA Darkside Mode) from _No More Heroes_, into _Doom_.


## Requirements
  GZDoom 4.13+,
  Doom 1/2.
## Features
  * Every time you kill an enemy/fill up the optional tension meter, a slot machine pops up, if all 3 icons match you get a powerup.
  * An options menu that lets players fine tune the UI, sounds, win chance, and the chances of winning certain powerups.
  * An optional Tension Gauge that triggers the slot machine once it's full, fill it by killing enemies.
  * The tiger morph powerup from _No More Heroes 2_. It turns the player into an invincible tiger that deals massive damage with it's sharp claws. (You need to activate it in the options menu first, it also might crash when playing with certain mods).

## Recommended mods
While I always designed this mod around compatibility,  
the mods I had in mind the most were _Doomer7_ (due to it also being Suda51 themed), and _Reelism_.
## Issues with certain mods.
  ### Minor issues
  * _Brutal Doom_/Any mod that uses Brutal Doom's gore system: If tension is disabled, 2 slot machines pop up on most kills. If it's on then you gain twice the tension per kill.
  * _LiTDoom_: Must manually pick up rewards spawned by the slot machine.
  * _Stray Mod_: Tiger Sprite appears on top of the player when Tiger morph is active.
  * _High Noon Drifter_ : Collecting the tiger morph while playing as Basilissa does nothing but still adds it to your inventory.
  
  ### Crashes
  ~~Any IWAD that doesn't use Doom's powerups such as Castlevania Simon's Destiny & Action Doom 2.~~  
  Fixed in Version 1.0.1
  ### Tiger Powerup Specific Crashes
  Mods that crash when triggering the Tiger Powerup (hence why it's disabled by default).
   * _Russian Overkill_ (Crashes after powerup wears off.)
   * _Sonic: Lock n Load_ (Only when playing as sonic, works fine with other characters.)
   * _La Tailor Girl_ 
   * _Guncaster_
   * _Hellrider_
## Copyright
Darkside mode is a doom mod based on the No More Heroes games by Grasshopper Manufacture. The rights to _No More Heroes_ belong to Marvelous Inc. The rights to _Doom_ belong to ID Software.  
Most of the sound effects from the mod are from _No More Heroes_ 2, and 3. As such, they belong to Marvelous.  
The exceptions are a vine-boom you can only get by summoning a hidden powerup from the console, and a stock anime slice sound effect for hitting enemies with tiger claws.  
The custom sprites were created by the author.  
The code was made entirely by the author (with some help from the ZDoom discord server).
