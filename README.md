## Issues with certain mods.
  ### Minor issues
  * Brutal Doom/Any mod that uses Brutal Doom's gore system: If tension is disabled, 2 slot machines pop up on most kills. If it's off then you gain twice the tension per kill.
  * LiTDoom: Must manually pick up rewards spawned by the slot machine.
  * Stray Mod: Tiger Sprite appears on top of cat when Tiger morph is active.
  
  ### Crashes
  Any IWAD that doesn't use Doom's powerups such as Castlevania Simon's Destiny & Action Doom 2.
  ### Tiger Powerup Specific Crashes
  Mods that crash when triggering the Tiger Powerup (hence why it's disabled by default).
   * Russian OverKill (Crashes after powerup wears off.)
   * Sonic: Lock n Load (Only when playing as sonic, works fine with other characters.)
   * La Tailor Girl 
   * Guncaster
   * Hellrider
